# *Is Parkinson’s Disease a Disorder of Failed Sleep–Wake State Separation?*

This article proposes that Parkinson’s disease (PD) is not solely a disorder of dopaminergic neuron loss but a failure of sleep–wake state separation, producing a pathological superposition of REM-like and wake-like neural programs. Persistent cortical overdrive destabilizes normally autonomous subcortical sleep–wake circuits, allowing REM motor suppression, dream-like cognition, and autonomic volatility to intrude into wakefulness while wake-like activity disrupts sleep. This state-mixing initiates a vicious cycle in which poor sleep further erodes state boundaries and impairs glymphatic clearance, promoting α-synuclein accumulation, neuroinflammation, and progressive neurodegeneration.

Parkinson’s disease is traditionally viewed as a neurodegenerative disorder rooted in dopaminergic deficits and α-synuclein pathology, yet these explanations do not fully account for the broad constellation of symptoms—especially early sleep disturbances, hallucinations, and autonomic dysfunction. The article advances an alternative hypothesis: PD arises from a chronic collapse of boundaries between REM sleep and waking consciousness, creating a persistent superposition in which incompatible neural programs operate simultaneously. The initiating factor is theorized to be cortical overdrive (COD), a state of excessive cortical activation that overwhelms the regulatory capacity of subcortical sleep–wake circuits, including the locus coeruleus and brainstem nuclei responsible for coordinating arousal, motor gating, and REM transitions.

This breakdown allows REM intrusions into wakefulness, such as REM-like motor suppression contributing to rigidity and bradykinesia, and dream-like cognition producing hallucinations and fluctuating attention. Conversely, wake-like activation intrudes into REM sleep, resulting in REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), insomnia, and fragmented architecture. These mixed states lead to autonomic dysregulation, as competing REM and wake autonomic commands destabilize blood pressure, digestion, thermoregulation, and heart-rate variability. Together, these manifestations reflect a failure of brainstem autonomy, where the brainstem can no longer maintain clean state distinctions due to persistent interference from cortical networks.

Once state-boundary collapse begins, a self-reinforcing neurodegenerative loop emerges. Disrupted sleep impairs the glymphatic system, which normally removes metabolic waste—including misfolded α-synuclein—during deep sleep. Reduced clearance accelerates protein accumulation, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, further damaging sleep–wake regulatory structures and reinforcing the superposition of REM-like and wake-like states. Over time, this dual-loop mechanism—COD-driven instability combined with glymphatic-inflammatory failure—amplifies neurodegeneration and unifies motor, cognitive, autonomic, and sleep abnormalities under a single pathophysiological framework.
