# dondurma-notes

A single-page notebook of short, one-page explainers on any topic.  
Each entry fits on one screen and one printed page.

The site is built from `index.md` and styled with a small Tufte-inspired CSS file.

To add a new entry, place it inside a `<div class="article">` block in `index.md`.

Hosted with GitHub Pages.
